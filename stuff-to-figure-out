I'm reading the docs on extending python with C.

It looks like functions defined in C have signuatures like:

    f(*args)

or:

    g(*args, **kwargs)

Is there some way to provide something more specific, like:

   h(a, b, c)


I need to look at this cython project.  It seems like a vastly simpler
way of speeding up code.
